The Caesar cipher but ***better*** !

# What is the Vigenère cipher ? 
The [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) is a more efficient version of the [Caesar cipher](https://github.com/dinosnake666/caesar-cipher). It can be easily tweaked to make it _almost_ unbreakable !

You can decipher the message with a [tabula recta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_recta) if you have the key.

### How to use the code ?
**Compile with `cc -Wall -Werror -Wextra main/main.c functions/*.c`**

**Syntax to use the code : `./executable_name` `"key"` `"plaintext"`**

>[!TIP]
> You can use sentences with non-alphabeticals !
