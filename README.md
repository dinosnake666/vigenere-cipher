The Caesar cipher but ***better*** !

# What is the Vigenère cipher ? 
The [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) is a more efficient version of the [Caesar cipher](https://github.com/dinosnake666/caesar_cipher). It can be easily tweaked to make it _almost_ unbreakable !
